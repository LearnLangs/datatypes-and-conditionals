    Here i will explain the data types in python
        there are multiple data types in python but the main eight are;
        1. Numeric type:
            consider numerics in python to be either positive or negative numbers within any range.
            in other languages numerics are further divide into three, four or more thus:
                1. Integers -: A set of positive and negative whole numbers
                2. Floats -: A set of positive and negative decimal numbers
                3. Complex -: A set of positive and negtive complex numbers
        
        2. Text type:
            consider text types in python to be either a character or array of characters and it can be anything it just have to be rapped in a quotation mark
            in other languages texts are further divide into two thus:
                1. Char -: A single character rapped in quotation mark
                2. String -: A set or array of characters rapped in a quotation mark
                
        3. Boolean type:
            consider booleans to be either true of false. in python they have their first letter capitalized
            booleans can binary numbers as 0 denotes false and 1 denotes true in the binary system.
        
        4. Sequence type:
            there are several explanation that can be given to this data type. 
            thus the sequence type mainly keep data in the sequencial order.
            there are three sequence types in python which may vary in other languages
            1. List -: As the name denotes, it is a list or set of data which may include any of the three types above
